# Inspect and manage Juiced

Use native discovery to inspect the server. Use the browser console for routine
mutations so you can review progress, dependencies, and reload consequences.
Operator controls require the admin credential when configured.

## Read the server state

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/v1/juiced/state
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/v1/juiced/catalog
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/v1/juiced/capabilities
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/v1/juiced/protocols
```

The operator catalog includes disabled registrations. Consumer discovery at
`/v1/models` includes only enabled available models. Native capabilities report
declared operations, component status, selected execution, and unknowns.

`/.well-known/juiced.json` points clients to native discovery.
The [capability contract](https://github.com/Nulifyer/Juiced/blob/main/juiced/CAPABILITIES.md) defines fields and their
limits. Unknown or unrecorded qualification is not a successful test.

## Read operational inventories

| Endpoint | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/juiced/devices?recipe=llamacpp&backend=cpu` | Devices for the selected recipe/backend; choose an installed variant for accelerator enumeration |
| `GET /v1/juiced/execution?model=MODEL_ID` | Selected profile, available profiles, and compatibility |
| `GET /v1/juiced/preparation?model=MODEL_ID` | Supported preparation plan |
| `GET /v1/juiced/transfers` | Acquisition jobs and their state |
| `GET /v1/juiced/cache` | Cache settings, snapshots, and operational state |
| `GET /v1/juiced/admission` | Pending work, reservations, allocations, and uncertain termination |
| `GET /v1/juiced/requests` | Bounded request metadata for diagnostics |

URL-encode model IDs in query parameters. Request metadata is not a stored
conversation API. The default native port for a source build is `13305`.
The Juiced container explicitly uses `8080`.

## Pause new work for maintenance

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/v1/juiced/admission \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"paused":true}'
```

This operator control rejects new and pending work. It does not interrupt active
inference or change model policies. Wait for active work to settle and unload
idle workers before changing resource topology. Resume with `{"paused":false}`.

Execution and preparation mutations share the native manager's model identities
and publication rules. See [runtime profiles](https://github.com/Nulifyer/Juiced/blob/main/juiced/RUNTIME-PROFILES.md)
and [resource admission](https://github.com/Nulifyer/Juiced/blob/main/juiced/RESOURCE-ADMISSION.md) for the detailed
source contracts. Raw `/internal/*` configuration operations are operator controls.

Native routes register `/api/v0/`, `/api/v1/`, `/v0/`, and `/v1/` aliases.
Ollama, Anthropic, AUTOMATIC1111, and MCP retain their protocol-specific paths.
